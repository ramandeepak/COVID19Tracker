# COVID19Tracker
COVID-19 Tracker - A simple web app that provides the pandemic distribution statistics. This app is basically feeding off of the free API provided by https://covid19api.com/  
It makes use of Chart.js, a javascript library to render a line graph that shows how the shape of the pandemic curve has changed over a period of time. The documentation of the library can be referred here https://www.chartjs.org/

To setup the project on your local machine follow the steps below:

1. Checkout the repo

2. Open the project folder in Visual Studio Code. (I prefer VS Code, you could use any IDE of your choice)

3. Open the terminal and run the following command inside the project root folder. This will install the necessary dependencies. Please note that for the below command to work you need npm (Node Package Manager) installed on your machine. Refer to this link if you want to know how to install npm. https://www.npmjs.com/get-npm

          npm install chart.js --save
  
4.  Finally, open the index.html file using the live preview server that comes with Visual Studio Code. If you are using a different IDE, refer to its documentation in order to find out how to run a html file on the local server.
